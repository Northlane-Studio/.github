# 👋 Welcome

We’re a small, product-driven team building early-stage software with a long-term mindset.

Our background is deeply technical — but our focus is not just code quality.  
We care about **outcomes, clarity, and compounding decisions**.

This organization hosts internal tools, product code, and experiments related to what we’re building.

## 🧠 How We Think

We believe:
- Titles don’t compound. Ownership does.
- Small scopes beat ambitious roadmaps.
- Constraints create focus, not limitations.
- Early decisions should reduce assumptions, not add complexity.

We optimize for:
- fast learning over premature scale  
- clear ownership over consensus  
- long-term trust over short-term velocity  

---

## 🛠 What We Build With

We choose tools pragmatically and keep things simple early.

Typical stack (varies by product):
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- React / Next.js
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Cloud-native infrastructure

We deliberately avoid premature abstraction and over-engineering.

## 🤝 Collaboration

We’re open to long-term, equity-aligned or hybrid collaborations with people who:
- think like owners
- communicate clearly
- care about product impact, not just implementation

We value:
- honesty about risk
- async-friendly work
- respect for time and focus

If this resonates, we’re probably aligned.

---

## 🌍 Remote & Global

We work remotely and collaborate across time zones.
What matters to us is **signal, trust, and consistency** — not location.
